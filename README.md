# Swords and Shields

### This is my version of the game Tic-Tac-Toe.  

To start, fight over who wants to be player 1. Player 1 will then choose either sword or shield. The first turn will then be randomly selected.

If either player lines up three swords or shields in a row (diagonally included) they win a point.

Press the reset button when you are ready to play again.

Good luck have fun.
